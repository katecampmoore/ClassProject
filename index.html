            <h2>Dear Friend</h2>
            <p> Thank you for taking the time to consider us as your child’s adoptive parents! You inspire us with your strength and dignity as you make this important decision for you and your child’s life. We know how hard of a decision this is for you and we want you to know how much we already love you and your child. Garrett and I have dreamed of adoption since before we were married, and are committed to providing a safe and loving home while providing educational and adventurous upbringing.
</p>
